		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Initial Stack",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup of the project repository and initial stack into subtasks such as repository creation, backend initialization, frontend initialization, CI/CD pipeline setup, linting/testing configuration, and folder structure definition.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple distinct activities across backend, frontend, and DevOps domains. Each step (repo creation, backend, frontend, CI/CD, linting, structure) is a separate concern and requires coordination, but none are individually highly complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "RD Station API Integration Setup",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the RD Station API integration into subtasks: application registration, OAuth 2.0 flow implementation, backend endpoint creation for contacts, backend endpoint for deals, backend endpoint for activities/notes, secure token storage, and API documentation review.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating with an external CRM using OAuth 2.0 and multiple endpoints introduces moderate complexity, especially around authentication, secure storage, and API contract adherence."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Twilio (or CPaaS) Voice API Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the Twilio Voice API integration into subtasks: Twilio account setup, API key management, backend endpoint for call initiation, WebRTC integration, call event webhook handling, call metadata storage, SDK usage, and test number validation.",
			"reasoning": "VoIP integration involves real-time communication, event-driven architecture, and secure handling of credentials and metadata, making it technically challenging and multifaceted."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Click-to-Call UI Integration in RD Station CRM",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the click-to-call UI integration into subtasks: marketplace integration research, Chrome extension development, UI injection logic, button event handling, backend call trigger, call status overlay, and end-to-end flow testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires both frontend (UI injection, overlays) and backend (call initiation) work, plus potential browser extension development and integration with a third-party CRM, increasing complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Automatic Call Logging in CRM",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose automatic call logging into subtasks: webhook event handling, call metadata retrieval, activity/note creation in CRM, recording URL management, error handling, and end-to-end flow validation.",
			"reasoning": "Automating call logging involves event-driven backend logic, data mapping between systems, and robust error handling, but is more linear than UI or real-time communication tasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Secure Call Recording Storage and Compliance",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand secure call recording storage into subtasks: encrypted cloud storage setup, recording upload implementation, time-limited URL generation, data retention policy enforcement, deletion logic, compliance checks, and access control validation.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines security, cloud storage, legal compliance (LGPD), and access control, each requiring careful implementation and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Metrics Dashboard and Reporting",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the metrics dashboard into subtasks: backend data aggregation, API for metrics, React dashboard scaffolding, chart integration, agent ranking logic, CRM analytics integration research, and data visualization testing.",
			"reasoning": "Building a dashboard requires backend aggregation, API design, frontend visualization, and optional third-party analytics integration, each with moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Onboarding, Documentation, and Support Materials",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose onboarding and documentation into subtasks: admin onboarding guide, user onboarding guide, FAQ creation, help article writing, in-app tooltip implementation, and campaign material preparation.",
			"reasoning": "This task is content-heavy but technically straightforward, involving documentation, UI help, and marketing material creation."
