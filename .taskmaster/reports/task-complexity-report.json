		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Initial Stack",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup of the project repository and initial stack into subtasks such as repository creation, backend initialization, frontend initialization, CI/CD pipeline setup, linting/testing configuration, and folder structure definition.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple distinct activities across backend, frontend, and DevOps domains. Each step (repo creation, backend, frontend, CI/CD, linting, structure) is a separate concern and requires coordination, but none are individually highly complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "RD Station API Integration Setup",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down each backend endpoint (contacts, deals, activities/notes) into separate subtasks for implementation and testing. Add subtasks for error handling, token refresh logic, and integration testing with real RD Station data.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves OAuth 2.0 authentication, secure token storage, and multiple backend integrations, each with its own API contract and error handling requirements. The current subtasks cover the main flows, but additional subtasks for error handling, token refresh, and integration testing would improve maintainability and reduce risk. The complexity is moderate due to the number of moving parts and external dependencies.[1][3]"

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Twilio (or CPaaS) Voice API Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand by adding subtasks for detailed error handling, security review of webhook endpoints, rate limiting, and integration testing with both Twilio and at least one alternative CPaaS provider. Include subtasks for documentation and monitoring setup.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating a CPaaS voice API involves real-time communication, event-driven webhooks, and secure handling of call metadata. The need to support both Twilio and alternatives, plus the requirement for robust event handling and security, increases complexity. Additional subtasks are needed for error handling, security, and cross-provider compatibility.[1][3][5]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Reusable Click-to-Call UI Component",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Add subtasks for accessibility review, cross-browser testing, component documentation, and adaptation for different embedding scenarios (e.g., Chrome Extension, web app, CRM iframe). Include subtasks for state management and mock API integration.",
			"reasoning": "Building a reusable UI component with adaptable integration points requires careful state management, UI/UX considerations, and compatibility testing. The current subtasks focus on Chrome Extension, but broader reuse and accessibility will require further breakdown.[1][3]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Automatic Call Logging in CRM",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand by adding subtasks for error handling, retry logic for failed CRM API calls, logging and monitoring, and validation of call metadata formatting. Include subtasks for integration testing and user notification on logging failures.",
			"reasoning": "This task is straightforward but involves coordination between call event handling and CRM API integration. Error handling and reliability are critical, so additional subtasks for robustness and monitoring are recommended. The complexity is moderate due to external dependencies and data consistency requirements.[1][3]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Secure Call Recording Storage and Compliance",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Add subtasks for encryption key management, audit logging, compliance documentation, and periodic review of retention policies. Include subtasks for integration with monitoring/alerting systems and user access request handling.",
			"reasoning": "Secure storage and compliance introduce significant complexity, especially with encryption, access controls, and legal requirements (LGPD). The current subtasks cover technical flows, but compliance and auditability require further breakdown. Complexity is high due to security and regulatory factors.[1][3][5]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Metrics Dashboard and Reporting",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand by adding subtasks for backend API design, data aggregation logic, frontend-backend integration, user role-based access, and export/reporting features. Include subtasks for visualization testing and performance optimization.",
			"reasoning": "Developing a metrics dashboard involves both backend data aggregation and frontend visualization, with potential for complex queries and performance considerations. Additional subtasks for access control, export features, and optimization are needed for a robust solution.[1][3]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Onboarding, Documentation, and Support Materials",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Add subtasks for user feedback collection, localization, periodic content review, and integration of documentation into the app UI. Include subtasks for preparing campaign materials and tracking engagement metrics.",
			"reasoning": "This is a content-heavy task with lower technical complexity but requires coordination and periodic updates. Additional subtasks for feedback, localization, and integration will ensure completeness and maintainability.[1][5]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Finalize Production Infrastructure Setup",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand by adding subtasks for infrastructure security review, automated deployment pipeline setup, rollback/backup procedures, and environment variable management. Include subtasks for infrastructure monitoring and alerting.",
			"reasoning": "Production infrastructure setup is critical but well-defined. Complexity is moderate due to the need for automation, documentation, and reliability. Additional subtasks for security, automation, and monitoring are recommended for production readiness.[1][3][5]"
