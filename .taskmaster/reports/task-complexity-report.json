		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Set Up Docker Infrastructure and CI for Backend and Frontend",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Docker/CI setup into subtasks: backend Dockerfile, frontend Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, .env.example files, GitHub Actions workflow, Supabase CLI documentation, CI type generation, and README instructions.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multi-service Dockerization, CI/CD integration, environment management, and documentation. Each step requires careful configuration and validation, with dependencies on external services (Supabase, Docker registry) and CI automation. The breadth and integration points increase both technical and organizational complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Easypanel Services and Automate Deployment",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: create Easypanel services, map environment variables, define health checks, configure persistent storage, set up deployment webhook, and verify configuration.",
			"reasoning": "This task covers infrastructure orchestration, secure configuration, health monitoring, persistent storage, and deployment automation. Each area is distinct and requires precise setup, but the process is well-defined and can be modularized."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Node.js/Express API with TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and RD Station OAuth Integration",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for project scaffolding, schema definition, RD CRM integration, secure token management, middleware/service for token injection, CRUD endpoints, rate limiting, unit/integration testing, and API documentation.",
			"reasoning": "This is a full backend implementation with external API integration, secure token handling, rate limiting, and comprehensive testing and documentation. The number of moving parts and the need for robust error handling and security make it highly complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Twilio Voice: Endpoints, Webhooks, Metadata, and SDK Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: install/configure Twilio SDK, implement call initiation endpoint, webhook endpoint, metadata storage, phone validation, error/logging, and documentation.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires secure integration with Twilio, real-time webhook handling, data persistence, validation, and robust error management. The need for secure credential management and compliance with Twilio best practices adds to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Reusable React Dialer Component with State Management and Backend Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: install dependencies, theme configuration, authentication integration, call status/recent calls, file upload, backend integration (REST/WebSocket), UI tests, and Storybook documentation.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines advanced frontend state management, real-time integration, authentication, file handling, and embeddability. Ensuring testability, extensibility, and compatibility with Chrome extensions increases the architectural and implementation complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Automatic Call Logging in CRM via Twilio Webhook and RD Station API",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: webhook endpoint, Twilio signature validation, metadata extraction, RD Station API integration, idempotency logic, retry mechanism, and logging/documentation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves secure webhook handling, cross-system data mapping, idempotency, retries, and robust logging. The need to ensure reliability and prevent duplicate CRM entries, while handling external API failures, makes it complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Secure Recording Storage with S3/Spaces: Encryption, Signed URLs, Retention, and LGPD Compliance",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: S3/Spaces bucket configuration, backend upload logic, signed URL generation, retention policy enforcement, audit logging, cleanup scripts, and compliance documentation.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires secure storage configuration, automated retention, compliance with data protection laws, and auditability. Each aspect (encryption, signed URLs, retention, audit) is critical and must be implemented with precision."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Metrics Dashboard with React, Chart.js, Aggregated API, and JWT Authentication",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: backend aggregation endpoint, JWT authentication, frontend dashboard layout, chart integration, API data fetching, route protection, and deployment scripts.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines backend data aggregation, secure API design, frontend visualization, and deployment. While each part is standard, the integration and need for secure, efficient data flow add moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Create Comprehensive Documentation, Onboarding, and Automated Docs Generation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: main README, Easypanel deployment guide, .env.example files, FAQ, video tutorials, in-app popovers, marketing materials, and CI docs automation.",
			"reasoning": "This task is broad but mostly procedural, involving documentation, onboarding, and automation. While it requires attention to detail and coordination, the technical complexity is lower than deep integration or backend tasks."
