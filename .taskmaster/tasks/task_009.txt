# Task ID: 9
# Title: Create Comprehensive Documentation, Onboarding, and Automated Docs Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a main README with dev/prod setup, Easypanel deployment guide, environment variable examples, FAQ, video tutorials, in-app popovers, marketing materials, and automate documentation generation in CI.
# Details:
1. Draft a detailed README.md covering project overview, local development setup, production deployment, and troubleshooting. Include step-by-step instructions for both backend and frontend, referencing Docker and docker-compose usage as established in the infrastructure tasks. 2. Write a dedicated section or separate guide for deploying the stack on Easypanel, including prerequisites (Docker, Easypanel installation), service setup, environment variable mapping, and health checks, referencing best practices from recent guides[1][2][4]. 3. Provide .env.example files for all services, with clear comments on required and optional variables. 4. Compile a FAQ addressing common developer and deployment issues. 5. Produce or curate short video tutorials for onboarding, setup, and deployment (hosted or linked). 6. Implement in-app popovers using a React library (e.g., react-tooltip or react-joyride) to guide users through key UI features. 7. Prepare a folder with marketing materials (logos, banners, elevator pitch, screenshots). 8. Integrate automated documentation generation (e.g., using Typedoc for backend, Storybook for frontend, and Markdown linting) into the CI pipeline, ensuring docs are built and published on every push to main. 9. Ensure all documentation is accessible from a central docs/ directory and linked from the README.

# Test Strategy:
- Review the README and onboarding guides for completeness, clarity, and accuracy by having a new developer follow them from scratch. - Verify that the Easypanel deployment guide works by deploying a fresh instance using the documented steps. - Check that all .env.example files are present and match the latest code requirements. - Test in-app popovers for correct display and contextual relevance in the UI. - Confirm that video tutorials are accessible and up to date. - Run the CI pipeline to ensure documentation is generated and published automatically. - Validate that marketing materials are present and correctly formatted. - Solicit feedback from at least one non-core team member to identify gaps or unclear sections.
