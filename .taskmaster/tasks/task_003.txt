# Task ID: 3
# Title: Twilio (or CPaaS) Voice API Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate Twilio (or equivalent CPaaS) for initiating and managing VoIP calls.
# Details:
Set up Twilio account and obtain API keys. Implement backend endpoints to initiate calls (WebRTC and call bridging). Use Twilio SDK for Node.js. Handle call events (answered, completed, failed) via webhooks. Store call metadata.

# Test Strategy:
Test call initiation and event handling with test numbers. Verify webhook integration and call metadata storage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Twilio Account Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and configure a Twilio account to enable access to the Voice API and related services.
### Details:
Sign up for a Twilio account, verify your email, and complete any required onboarding steps. Obtain your Account SID and Auth Token from the Twilio Console.

## 2. API Key Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Generate and securely store Twilio API keys for authenticating API requests.
### Details:
Create API keys and secrets in the Twilio Console. Store them securely in environment variables or a secrets manager. Use API keys for authentication in production environments as recommended by Twilio.

## 3. Backend Endpoint for Call Initiation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Develop a backend endpoint to initiate outbound calls using the Twilio Voice API.
### Details:
Implement an API endpoint (e.g., RESTful POST) that receives call initiation requests and uses the Twilio SDK or REST API to create calls. Ensure proper authentication and error handling.

## 4. WebRTC Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Integrate Twilio's WebRTC SDK to enable real-time voice communication in the client application.
### Details:
Install and configure the Twilio Voice SDK for Web or mobile platforms. Set up client-side logic to connect to calls using WebRTC, handling media streams and device permissions.

## 5. Call Event Webhook Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Implement webhook endpoints to receive and process call event notifications from Twilio.
### Details:
Create HTTP endpoints to handle Twilio webhook POST requests for call events (e.g., call started, ringing, completed). Parse event payloads and respond with appropriate HTTP status codes.

## 6. Call Metadata Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Design and implement storage for call metadata received from Twilio webhooks and API responses.
### Details:
Store relevant call details (e.g., call SID, from/to numbers, timestamps, status) in a database for auditing, analytics, or user-facing features.

## 7. SDK Usage and Helper Library Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Integrate and utilize Twilio's official SDKs and helper libraries in the backend and client applications.
### Details:
Install the appropriate Twilio SDKs (e.g., Node.js, Java, Python) and use them to interact with the Voice API, manage calls, and handle authentication.

## 8. Test Number Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Implement logic to validate and manage test phone numbers for development and QA environments.
### Details:
Configure Twilio test credentials and use Twilio-provided test numbers to simulate calls without incurring charges. Ensure validation logic prevents production calls during testing.
