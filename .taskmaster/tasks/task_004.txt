# Task ID: 4
# Title: Integrate Twilio Voice: Endpoints, Webhooks, Metadata, and SDK Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement endpoints to initiate voice calls via Twilio, receive and process Twilio Voice webhooks, store call metadata, configure the Twilio SDK, validate phone numbers, handle errors, and manage credentials via environment variables.
# Details:
1. Install and configure the Twilio Node.js SDK, ensuring credentials (Account SID, Auth Token) are securely loaded from environment variables. 2. Implement an endpoint to initiate outbound calls using the Twilio REST API, accepting validated phone numbers as input and handling errors gracefully. 3. Set up endpoints to receive Twilio Voice webhooks (e.g., call status callbacks), ensuring secure HTTPS and verification of Twilio requests. 4. Parse and store relevant call metadata (such as call SID, status, timestamps, and phone numbers) in the database using Prisma. 5. Implement phone number validation logic to ensure only valid, supported numbers are used for outbound calls. 6. Provide robust error handling and logging for all Twilio interactions. 7. Document required environment variables and update .env.example accordingly. 8. Follow Twilio's best practices for webhook security and response handling, including returning appropriate HTTP status codes and, where required, TwiML responses.

# Test Strategy:
- Write unit and integration tests for the call initiation endpoint, including validation and error scenarios. - Use Twilio's test credentials and mock webhooks to simulate incoming events and verify webhook endpoint behavior. - Confirm that call metadata is correctly stored in the database for both outbound and inbound calls. - Manually test with real Twilio numbers to ensure end-to-end functionality. - Check that environment variables are loaded and credentials are not hardcoded. - Review logs for error handling and security compliance. - Use tools like Postman or curl to send mock webhook requests and validate responses.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Configure Twilio SDK [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the Twilio SDK in the project environment, securely configure credentials, and verify connectivity with Twilio services.
### Details:
Install the official Twilio SDK for your programming language. Store the Account SID and Auth Token securely (e.g., environment variables). Test the connection by making a simple API call to Twilio.

## 2. Implement Call Initiation Endpoint (POST /call) [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop an authenticated POST endpoint to initiate outbound calls using the Twilio SDK.
### Details:
Create the /call endpoint. Accept parameters such as destination phone number and caller ID. Use the Twilio SDK to initiate the call and handle the response.

## 3. Implement Webhook Endpoint (/twilio/webhook) [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create an endpoint to receive and process Twilio webhook events related to call status and events.
### Details:
Develop the /twilio/webhook endpoint to handle POST requests from Twilio. Parse incoming event data and respond with appropriate status codes.

## 4. Store Call Metadata in Supabase [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Persist call metadata (e.g., call SID, status, timestamps, participants) in the 'calls' table of Supabase.
### Details:
Design the schema for the 'calls' table if not already present. Insert or update call records based on webhook events and call initiation responses.

## 5. Phone Number Validation and Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement validation for phone numbers and robust error handling for all endpoints.
### Details:
Validate phone numbers using regex or Twilio Lookup API. Handle errors from Twilio API calls and webhook processing, returning meaningful error messages.

## 6. Logging and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3, 4.5
### Description: Integrate logging and monitoring for call initiation, webhook events, and error scenarios.
### Details:
Log all incoming requests, responses, and errors. Set up monitoring/alerting for failures or suspicious activity. Ensure logs do not expose sensitive information.

## 7. Documentation and Usage Examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6
### Description: Document the API endpoints, configuration steps, and provide usage examples for developers.
### Details:
Write clear documentation for endpoint usage, request/response formats, error codes, and setup instructions. Include example requests and responses.
