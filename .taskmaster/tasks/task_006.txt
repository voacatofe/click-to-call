# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Automatic Call Logging in CRM via Twilio Webhook and RD Station API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a backend service that listens for Twilio call webhooks, retrieves call metadata, and logs activities or notes in RD Station via API, ensuring retries and idempotency. Include comprehensive end-to-end tests.
# Details:
1. Set up an HTTP endpoint to receive Twilio webhook events for call status updates (e.g., completed, failed). Validate incoming requests to ensure authenticity (e.g., Twilio signature verification). 2. Upon receiving a webhook, extract relevant call metadata (call SID, status, duration, participants, timestamps, etc.). 3. Implement logic to fetch any additional metadata from Twilio if needed (using Twilio REST API). 4. Use the RD Station API to create or update an activity/note associated with the relevant contact or deal, mapping Twilio call data to RD Station fields. 5. Ensure idempotency by tracking processed webhook events (e.g., via call SID or a unique event ID) to prevent duplicate CRM entries. 6. Implement a robust retry mechanism for both Twilio and RD Station API interactions, handling transient failures and respecting rate limits. 7. Log all processing steps and errors for observability. 8. Document the integration flow and provide configuration options for webhook URLs, API credentials, and retry policies.

# Test Strategy:
- Write unit tests for webhook parsing, Twilio signature validation, and RD Station API payload construction. - Mock Twilio and RD Station APIs to simulate various scenarios (success, failure, duplicate events, network errors). - Implement end-to-end tests that trigger a simulated Twilio webhook, verify correct metadata extraction, and confirm that the expected activity/note appears in RD Station. - Test idempotency by sending duplicate webhook events and ensuring only one CRM entry is created. - Validate retry logic by simulating transient API failures and confirming successful eventual delivery.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Webhook Endpoint /twilio/log-call [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up an HTTP POST endpoint at /twilio/log-call to receive webhook events from Twilio.
### Details:
Implement the endpoint using your web framework of choice, ensuring it can parse incoming requests from Twilio and respond with the appropriate status code as quickly as possible to avoid timeouts.[5][3]

## 2. Validate Twilio Signature [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Implement logic to verify the authenticity of incoming webhook requests using Twilio's signature validation.
### Details:
Extract the X-Twilio-Signature header and validate it against the request body and your Twilio Auth Token to ensure the request is genuinely from Twilio.[5]

## 3. Extract Metadata and Map to RD CRM Model [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Parse the webhook payload to extract relevant call metadata and map it to the RD Station CRM data model.
### Details:
Identify required fields (e.g., call SID, phone numbers, timestamps) and transform them into the format expected by the RD Station API.[4][2]

## 4. Implement Idempotency via Call SID in Supabase [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Ensure that each call is processed only once by storing and checking the Twilio Call SID in Supabase.
### Details:
Before processing, check if the Call SID already exists in Supabase. If it does, skip processing to prevent duplicate CRM entries.

## 5. Integrate RD CRM API with Retries and Backoff [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Send the mapped data to the RD Station CRM API, implementing retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures.
### Details:
Use the RD Station API to create tasks or notes. On failure, retry the request with increasing delays, handling rate limits and network errors gracefully.[2]

## 6. Logging, Monitoring, and Failure Alerts [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.5
### Description: Implement robust logging of all webhook events, API interactions, and errors. Set up monitoring and alerting for failures.
### Details:
Log incoming requests, processing steps, and errors for audit and debugging. Integrate with monitoring tools to alert on repeated failures or anomalies.[5]

## 7. Documentation and End-to-End Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document the entire integration process and develop end-to-end tests to validate all logic and error handling.
### Details:
Provide clear setup, usage, and troubleshooting documentation. Write automated tests simulating Twilio webhooks and verifying correct CRM updates and idempotency.
