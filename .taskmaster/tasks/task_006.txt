# Task ID: 6
# Title: Secure Call Recording Storage and Compliance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement secure storage and management of call recordings with compliance to LGPD.
# Details:
Store call recordings in encrypted cloud storage (e.g., Amazon S3). Generate secure, time-limited access URLs. Implement data retention and deletion policies. Ensure compliance with LGPD for personal data.

# Test Strategy:
Test recording upload, download, and deletion. Verify access controls and compliance checks.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Encrypted Cloud Storage Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure and provision secure, encrypted cloud storage for call recordings, ensuring compliance with industry standards and best practices.
### Details:
Select a cloud provider supporting end-to-end encryption and data integrity checks. Set up storage buckets or containers with encryption at rest and in transit. Document encryption keys management procedures.

## 2. Recording Upload Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop and integrate the logic to securely upload call recordings to the encrypted cloud storage, ensuring data integrity and reliability.
### Details:
Implement upload APIs or SDKs, validate checksums during upload, and handle upload errors or retries. Ensure uploads are logged for audit purposes.

## 3. Time-Limited URL Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Implement functionality to generate secure, time-limited URLs for accessing stored call recordings.
### Details:
Use cloud provider mechanisms (e.g., signed URLs) to allow temporary, controlled access to recordings. Ensure URLs expire after the defined period and cannot be reused.

## 4. Data Retention Policy Enforcement [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Automate enforcement of data retention policies to ensure recordings are stored only for the legally required period.
### Details:
Configure lifecycle management rules in cloud storage to automatically delete or archive recordings after the retention period. Document retention schedules and exceptions.

## 5. Deletion Logic Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Develop and test secure deletion logic for call recordings, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
### Details:
Implement deletion workflows that securely erase recordings from storage, including metadata and backups. Log all deletion actions for auditability.

## 6. Compliance Checks (e.g., LGPD) [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4, 6.5
### Description: Review and validate that all storage, access, and deletion processes comply with relevant legal and regulatory requirements such as LGPD.
### Details:
Conduct compliance audits, document findings, and address any gaps. Ensure processes support data subject rights (e.g., right to erasure, access logs).

## 7. Access Control Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.6
### Description: Test and validate access controls to ensure only authorized users can access, download, or manage call recordings.
### Details:
Review and test role-based access controls, audit access logs, and perform penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
