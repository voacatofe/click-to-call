# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Initial Stack
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Initialize project repository with Node.js/TypeScript backend and React frontend, set up CI/CD pipeline, and define initial project structure.
# Details:
Create a new GitHub repository. Initialize with Node.js/TypeScript for backend (using Express or NestJS), React for frontend. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Configure linting, testing, and code formatting. Define folder structure for backend (src, tests, config) and frontend (src, public, components).

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository setup by running initial linting and test scripts. Ensure CI/CD pipeline triggers on push.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Project Repository [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new repository in the chosen version control system (e.g., GitHub), including a README file and initial security settings.
### Details:
Initialize the repository, add a README to communicate project details, and configure basic security features such as branch protection and secret scanning.

## 2. Define Folder Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Establish a clear and organized folder structure for backend, frontend, and shared resources.
### Details:
Create directories for backend, frontend, and any shared modules or documentation. Ensure the structure supports scalability and maintainability.

## 3. Initialize Backend Stack [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up the backend framework, initialize dependencies, and create starter files.
### Details:
Choose a backend technology (e.g., Node.js, Python), initialize the project (e.g., npm init), and set up entry points and configuration files.

## 4. Initialize Frontend Stack [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up the frontend framework, initialize dependencies, and create starter files.
### Details:
Choose a frontend technology (e.g., React, Vue), initialize the project (e.g., create-react-app), and set up entry points and configuration files.

## 5. Configure Linting and Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Set up linting and testing tools for both backend and frontend to ensure code quality and consistency.
### Details:
Install and configure linters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) and testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Mocha) for both backend and frontend codebases.

## 6. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.5
### Description: Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate building, testing, and deploying the application.
### Details:
Configure a CI/CD tool (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run builds, tests, linting, and deployments on code changes, ensuring automated quality checks and deployments.
