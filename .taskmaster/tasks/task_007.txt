# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Secure Recording Storage with S3/Spaces: Encryption, Signed URLs, Retention, and LGPD Compliance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a secure storage solution for call recordings using S3/Spaces with encryption, signed URL generation, automated retention policies, and LGPD compliance, including cleanup and audit scripts.
# Details:
1. Configure S3/Spaces buckets to enforce server-side encryption for all uploaded recordings, leveraging default encryption (SSE-S3) or customer-managed keys as required for compliance[1][3]. 2. Implement backend logic to upload recordings to S3/Spaces, ensuring all uploads use HTTPS and include metadata for retention and audit purposes. 3. Generate pre-signed URLs for controlled, time-limited access to recordings, supporting both upload and download scenarios[2][4]. 4. Define and enforce automatic retention policies: store metadata (e.g., upload timestamp, retention period) and implement scheduled scripts or Lambda functions to delete recordings after the retention period expires, ensuring compliance with LGPD data minimization requirements. 5. Develop an audit logging mechanism to track all access and deletion events, storing logs securely and making them available for compliance reviews. 6. Provide a script or scheduled job for periodic cleanup of expired recordings and for generating audit reports. 7. Document all security controls, encryption settings, and compliance measures, including procedures for data subject requests (e.g., deletion on demand).

# Test Strategy:
- Verify that all uploaded recordings are encrypted at rest by inspecting S3/Spaces object properties and encryption headers. - Test generation and expiration of pre-signed URLs for both upload and download, ensuring access is only possible within the allowed time window. - Simulate retention policy by uploading test files with short retention periods and confirming automated deletion after expiry. - Review audit logs to ensure all access, deletion, and retention events are accurately recorded. - Perform LGPD compliance checks: validate that data can be deleted on request and that retention policies are enforced. - Conduct security review to confirm that only authorized users can generate signed URLs and access recordings.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Encrypted Storage Bucket [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a Supabase Storage or S3/Spaces bucket with encryption enabled to ensure secure storage of recordings.
### Details:
Verify encryption support and correct configuration in the storage provider dashboard. Ensure the encryption algorithm is supported and properly set to avoid BucketEncryptionError or FileEncryptionError.[1][3]

## 2. Implement Backend Signed Upload Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop a backend endpoint that generates signed upload URLs for clients to securely upload recordings.
### Details:
Use server-side credentials (access_key and secret_key) to generate signed URLs, ensuring uploads are authenticated and scoped per user or role as needed.[2][4]

## 3. Generate Signed Playback URLs [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Create logic to generate signed URLs for secure playback access to stored recordings.
### Details:
Ensure playback URLs are time-limited and respect access control policies, leveraging S3-compatible signed URL mechanisms or Supabase's RLS features.[2]

## 4. Automate Retention Policy Enforcement [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Set up a scheduled process (cron job or script) to automatically delete recordings after a defined retention period.
### Details:
Implement logic to scan the bucket and remove files older than the retention threshold, ensuring compliance with data minimization requirements.

## 5. Enable Audit Logging and Access Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Configure audit logs to track uploads, downloads, and deletions of recordings for security and compliance.
### Details:
Ensure all access events are logged with user identity, timestamp, and action details. Store logs securely for later review.

## 6. Develop Manual Cleanup Script and Testing Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Create a script for manual cleanup of recordings and design tests to validate retention and deletion logic.
### Details:
Script should allow selective deletion and provide output for verification. Test cases must cover edge scenarios and error handling.

## 7. Prepare LGPD Compliance Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.4, 7.5
### Description: Document storage, retention, and access policies to demonstrate compliance with LGPD and provide operational instructions.
### Details:
Include encryption details, retention schedules, audit log procedures, and user rights handling. Ensure documentation is clear for audits.
